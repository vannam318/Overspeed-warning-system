By utilizing sensors and Arduino boards, the system creates a virtual environment for users to practice and refine their riding skills safely. Moreover, it integrates the YOLOv8 image recognition model to identify speed limit signs on the road and adjust speeds accordingly.

This system provides an automated mechanism to maintain safe speeds while riding. It swiftly detects and responds to speed limit signs, reducing the risk of traffic violations and ensuring riders adapt to the street environment appropriately.

The strength of this topic lies in its innovative application of technology to improve traffic safety, particularly in a country where motorcycles are a predominant mode of transportation. By employing image recognition alongside Arduino and simulation devices, it creates an intelligent system capable of adapting to various road conditions.

However, practical implementation may encounter challenges such as ensuring system stability in real-world scenarios and reliable recognition of speed limit signs under different lighting conditions. Additionally, it's essential to prevent the system from causing interference or hazards during actual riding.

In essence, this project not only focuses on enhancing driving skills but also aims to elevate safety and compliance with traffic regulations through technological advancements. Despite potential challenges, the integration of Arduino, image recognition, and simulation technologies represents a significant step towards improving road safety and fostering responsible driving behavior among motorcyclists in Vietnam.
